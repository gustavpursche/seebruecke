## Shortcodes

The whole frontpage is composed through shortcodes. If you want to use any of the widgets there, or even more, please have a look into the "Startpage" of each language.


### Featured

`[featured id="" [title=""] [subtitle=""]]`

The featured shortcode can be used to create a teaser to a certain page. It expects `id` (the wordpress page id) and will the use the featured image of the page as background-image and the title of the page as text, which is linked to the page itself.

It is possible to overwrite `title` by setting the `title` attribute. `subtitle` is used to generate a text, which is prefixed to the title and a bit smaller.


### Paypal

Renders a donate with paypal widget.

`[paypal]`


### Supporting organizations

Renders a list of supporting organizations.

`[supporting_organizations]`


### Become supporter

Renders the "Become a supporter" columns. `[become_supporter]` always consists of `[become_supporter_item]`s.

[become_supporter_item icon="flag|bulhorn|users" title=""]content[/become_supporter_item]
[become_supporter_item title=""]content[/become_supporter_item]
[/become_supporter]
```


### Donate
